Scripts to work out little things I think about using Maths

## added-mulitples.py
I was thinking about how 3 + 6 (9) is the half of 3 x 6 (18) and wanted to work out how many other possible sets of numbers satisfied this same idea.
- The script will also (by changing the value of p) work with different multiples.
- 'if x != p:' is necessary to stop divide by zero errors.
